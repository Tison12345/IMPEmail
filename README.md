# IMPEmail

**A Privacy-Focused Deadline Management Assistant Using Large Language Models**

## 📌 Overview

IMPEmail is a mobile application that helps users manage email-based deadlines efficiently and securely. It leverages on-device Large Language Models (LLMs) to scan emails, extract deadlines, and schedule notifications—all while ensuring full user privacy.

Unlike cloud-based solutions, IMPEmail processes data entirely on the user's device, supporting offline functionality and eliminating the risk of data leaks.

## ✨ Features

- 🔔 **Automated Notifications**: Sends reminders before deadlines.
- 📥 **Smart Email Scanning**: Uses LLM to identify deadlines within emails.
- 🧭 **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean dashboard to manage deadlines and settings.

Users often miss deadlines due to:
- High email volume
- Manual reminder setup
- Reliance on internet/cloud-based tools
- Privacy concerns with third-party apps

**IMPEmail** solves all of these by providing an automated, local solution.
